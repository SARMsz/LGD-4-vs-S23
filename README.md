<h1>LGD-4 vs S23 – My Brutally Honest Review After 2 Full Cycles</h1>

<p>If you’re trying to pick between <strong>LGD-4</strong> and <strong>S23</strong>, this article will make that choice easier. I’ve tested both on separate cycles, tracked my results, and paid close attention to side effects, strength gains, and how they compare for bulking, cutting, or body recomposition.</p>

<p>This isn’t a theory-based article. I actually used both compounds, tracked bloodwork, strength metrics, and lean mass changes. Below is everything I’ve learned from firsthand experience—plus links to the same sources I used.</p>

<h2>LGD-4 (Ligandrol Derivative) – What Happened When I Ran It</h2>

<p><strong>LGD-4</strong> is a modified version of <strong>LGD-4033</strong>, designed to improve anabolic activity while lowering androgenic effects. I ran it at <strong>10mg/day for 8 weeks</strong> during a clean bulk phase. I paired it with a slight calorie surplus (+300/day) and kept training heavy (5-day upper/lower split).</p>

<h3>My Results on LGD-4:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>+7 lbs lean mass gain by Week 8 (verified via DEXA)</li>
  <li>Huge strength boost—squat and bench both jumped fast</li>
  <li>Pumps felt full and tight, especially in shoulders and arms</li>
  <li>Mild suppression around Week 6 (but not severe)</li>
  <li>Zero water retention or bloat</li>
</ul>

<p>What I liked most was how <strong>clean and stable</strong> LGD-4 felt. It’s stronger than Ostarine or ACP-105, but it doesn’t wreck your hormones like S23 might. I still recommend doing a mini PCT just in case, but it’s mild overall.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Perfect for clean bulks</li>
  <li>Lean muscle growth without water weight</li>
  <li>Minimal aggression or mood swings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Suppression does kick in if you go over 10mg</li>
  <li>Not ideal for cutting—better for size and strength</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Bulking, Recomp, Intermediate Users</p>

<h2>S23 – The Most Powerful SARM I’ve Ever Used (and Why I Won’t Again Soon)</h2>

<p><strong>S23</strong> is often labeled as a <strong>“hardcore cutting SARM”</strong>, but it’s more like a mini steroid. I ran it at <strong>15mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a strict cut, eating 500 calories under maintenance with 200g+ protein per day. It gave me fast results, but with some clear downsides.</p>

<h3>My Results on S23:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Incredible fat loss (visible abs by Week 5)</li>
  <li>Lean and dry look—veins popping everywhere</li>
  <li>Held onto strength surprisingly well</li>
  <li>Suppression was serious—libido dropped hard by Week 4</li>
  <li>Sleep got worse and aggression went up</li>
</ul>

<p>S23 is NOT beginner-friendly. It’s aggressive and will shut you down if you’re not careful. That said, the fat loss and muscle definition were insane. I had veins on my lower abs and delts that I’ve never seen before. But I also had to run Nolva for 4 weeks after and felt drained during the final stretch.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Extreme fat-burning and muscle hardening</li>
  <li>No water retention at all</li>
  <li>Ideal for contest prep or final cut</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Heavy suppression (PCT mandatory)</li>
  <li>Insomnia and mood swings</li>
  <li>Not for beginners or casual users</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Advanced Users, Short Cycles</p>

<h2>LGD-4 vs S23 – Which One Should You Use?</h2>

<p>This comparison really comes down to one question: Are you bulking or cutting?</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SARM</th>
      <th>Best Use</th>
      <th>Strength Gains</th>
      <th>Suppression</th>
      <th>Side Effects</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>LGD-4</strong></td>
      <td>Bulking / Recomp</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>Mild</td>
      <td>Low</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>S23</strong></td>
      <td>Cutting / Shredding</td>
      <td>Moderate</td>
      <td>Severe</td>
      <td>Moderate–High</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Use <strong>LGD-4</strong> if you want size, strength, and muscle volume. Use <strong>S23</strong> only if you’re ready to get shredded and handle the suppression that comes with it. I’ll personally use LGD-4 again, but I’ll save S23 for short pre-summer cuts or comp prep.</p>

<h2>My Testing Setup (For Anyone Curious)</h2>

<p>When I test SARMs, I don’t stack them with anything else. I keep calories, sleep, and training routines stable. I measure progress by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weekly photos and weight</li>
  <li>Strength in 3 big lifts (bench, squat, OHP)</li>
  <li>Bloodwork before and after each cycle</li>
  <li>Suppression symptoms (libido, mood, sleep)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t take these compounds lightly. I track everything and run support supplements as needed.</p>

<h2>FAQs – LGD-4 vs S23</h2>

<h3>Do LGD-4 and S23 need a PCT?</h3>
<p>LGD-4 might not, but I still recommend a mini PCT. S23 100% needs a full PCT—don’t skip it.</p>

<h3>Can I stack LGD-4 and S23 together?</h3>
<p>You can, but only if you're experienced. The suppression and side effects will be higher.</p>

<h3>Which is better for fat loss?</h3>
<p>S23 is the better option for cutting and shredding. LGD-4 is more for lean bulking.</p>

<h3>Is LGD-4 stronger than LGD-4033?</h3>
<p>Yes, slightly. It’s designed to be a more refined version with a better anabolic ratio.</p>

<h3>Where do I get legit LGD-4 and S23?</h3>
<p>I use Chemyo for both:</p>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>

<p>If you want <strong>clean, strong gains with less suppression</strong>, go with <strong>LGD-4</strong>. It’s easier to run and more versatile. But if you’re <strong>cutting down for summer or a show</strong> and want a dry, hard physique fast, <strong>S23 delivers—but comes with a cost</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll run LGD-4 again for lean bulks. S23 is more of a once-a-year weapon in my arsenal.</p>
